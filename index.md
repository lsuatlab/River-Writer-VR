### Description 
River Writer is a virtual-reality based interactive poetry-writing application being actively developed. Set on a virtual levee at the golden hour, users fish 3D text (words) out of a literal stream (of consciousness). This text stream is populated by a custom text generating neural network trained on the born-digital text “Diamonds in Dystopia” written by Vincent Cellucci. The user then has the ability to carry and drop these word selections on an environment that essentially acts as a couplet palette in the three cardinal directions opposing the river of words. Over the course of “creative play,” a user has space to create at least 3 couplets or 6 lines of poetry by intentionally placing the fished diction on the levee. 

This application and level was created by Vincent Cellucci with assistance from Marc Aubanel using Unreal Game Engine 4. The machine learning component was added by Derick Ostrenko. The words were modeled easily, albeit individually, in Rhinoceros 6 using the text function. 

This project also has applications in the larger context of learning technologies and museum studies and pursues the following research questions: 1) Does the uncurated VR move us away from linear presentations of art and authority and bring with it advantages for new experiences with language? 2) How could the changes these technologies affect in the presentation of fine arts and electronic lieterature be considered and applied to guide the creation of the traditional media, art objects contained within? 3) How can these technologies be used as teaching tools within creative disciplines?
